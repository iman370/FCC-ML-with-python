How did I find this challenge?

It was a bit challenging since it was my first ever CNN model. I struggled the most with creating a model with a suitable accuracy - I had to trial and error different models and some of the models ended up taking a lot of time to train.

How did I find this challenge?

This one was definitely the hardest since I've never made a KNN model before. However, at the end I realised that I spent more time pre-processing the data and about 5-10 minutes figuring out how to create the KNN model.

How did I find this challenge?

It was easier than the others - however I struggled with getting the data in the right form (turning strings into numeric values).

How did I find this challenge?

The hardest part of this challenge was encoding each word into an integer manually. When I learnt about encoding datasets (the movie review NLP project using the imdb dataset), it was already done for my by the time I loaded in the dataset. I got to it in the end and it wasn't as hard as it seemed at all.

My model had also compiled with near perfect accuracy and this was a bit worrying incase I had overfit the training and testing data. However, thankfully that wasn't the case.
